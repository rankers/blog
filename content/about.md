## Technology, People, Products

I've fascinated by the socio-technical pursuit of creating products made out of code. I love all things technology related and invest my time keeping up with an amazingly complex and fast moving world.

I started my programming journey back at university years ago and continue to be a software engineer at heart. I've worked at a few start ups early in my career however the last 7 year have been at a consultancy working on a variety of projects using a mix of technologies. In that time I've enjoyed building a number of cloud native, distributed systems.

I'll be delving into Engineering, Architecture, DevOps/Agile movements, Team Leadership, Book Reviews and whatever else would be interesting to write about. Can head over to my [obligatory init post](/posts/init) to read a little more about my reasoning and aims for writing a tech blog.
