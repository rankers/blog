# History

Domain Driven Design (DDD) is a phrase bandied about a lot in the world of microservices but I feel decomposing a domain into services and partitioning them along fairly standard planes is only a small part of the process that gets attention. Theres a whole host of behaviours and technical practices that make up DDD that we should focus on. Those that do pay attention stop after decomposing or recomposing their services after the initial pass. To give an example I see a lot of decomposition along obvious lines that maybe fail to get to the breakthrough point of DDD due to lack of time or lack of attention to the things we'll discuss here.

First off read the book! Eric Evans - Domain Driven Design. It can be dense in places especially the first part but get past the set up and get into the application of the new knowledge you've just learned and its amazing.

Eric Evans sees DDD as part of Extreme Programming Paradigm - an approach that emphasizes pairing and human interaction but more on this later.

# Definitions

Ubiquitous Language - this is the shared language we all use to describe every day things and events within yoir domain. See if you notice in conversations with colleagues common words and phrases that descries the domain. Eric Evans believes this ubiquitous language should be continually reflected in code. Any change in language calls for a refactor.

Why I like this approach as it doesn't focus on developers as lone geeks in basements coding away. It posits development as a social activity of continual discussion and information sharing.

Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates

Side effect free functions - touch on this in Martin Fowlers Refactoring.

# Example

Paint! How to model paint! We couldn't get anymore boring if we tried but stick with me. The example of modelling paint shows how the domain context affects the design of the code.

# Bounded Contexts

# Refactoring

## Digging for concepts

Love this phrase, it evokes the attritional affair that finding the right fit is. It also means good design isn't hit upon first time. You have to learn the domain
